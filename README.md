## Running the app

#### Mind that the server is hosted on Render, which turns the app off after certain time of inactivity :( <br/> If you're left with loading screen, please open [server link](https://tokenguard-task.onrender.com) to spin it up (when you see `Cannot GET /` it's running - it takes a bit), and then refresh the [client page](https://master--tokenguard-task-ws.netlify.app/). Sorry for the inconveniences, have a good one.

Client: https://master--tokenguard-task-ws.netlify.app/ <br/>
Server: https://tokenguard-task.onrender.com

#### Additional features:
- Theming
- Support for multiple chains
- data zoom of the chart
